Hello! My name is Raquel and here is a picture of me chilling:

This picture was taken in Barcelona during a dark period of my life where I was working for a large international company doing a job I did not enjoy while trying to write my final bachelor's thesis. At that point, I quit my job, focused only on my thesis, flew back to Portugal while the Covid situation was becoming uncontrollable in Spain (one day before the airport closed), got sick with Covid for 2 months and had a lot of time to think about my life and about what I wanted. 
I graduated and took a leap of faith into a compltely different field to me: Data Science. 
There is so much history in between, but no time to explain (maybe in another post ;) )

Now that you know my face and a little bit about myself, let me explain what this website is for! 

Basically, this website is a platform for me to record my learnings and my journey into the world of Data Science. 
Currently, I am living in Lisbon and have been reading, studying and developing in this field since last year's summer (2020). Coming from a Business background, I must admit it wasn't and still isn't a smooth ride.  However, with the help and guidance from my teacher and mentor Saghir, I have been able to learn a lot!
